      <h1>üë©‚Äçüíª This page lists all the HTML elements, which are created using tags.</h1>
      Represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or
      navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a
      search form, an author name, and other elements.
    </header>

    <h2>HTML elements reference</h2>
    <div>
      The generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or
      layout until styled in some way using CSS (e.g., styling is directly
      applied to it, or some kind of layout model like flexbox is applied to its
      parent element). represents the content of an HTML document. There can be
      only one such element in a document.
    </div>
    <section>
      Represents a generic standalone section of a document, which doesn't have
      a more specific semantic element to represent it. Sections should always
      have a heading, with very few exceptions.
    </section>

      <strong> Indicates that its contents have strong importance, seriousness, or urgency. Browsers typically render the contents in bold type. </strong>
    </p>
    <span> A generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang. It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate. span is very much like a div element, but div is a block-level element whereas a span is an inline-level element.</span>

    <footer>Represents a footer for its nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectioning root element. A <footer> typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents.
